# Advent of Code 2022

This year I'm doing it in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)!

## Running

By request of AoC creator, I haven't included the input files (e.g. 
`src/input/day01.txt`). Log into [the Advent of Code 
site](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) and save the inputs there to the 
`src/input/` folder.

Then to run: `zig build run`.

To run in super-fast prod mode: `zig build -Drelease-fast run`.

To run the tests against included test input files: `zig build test`.
